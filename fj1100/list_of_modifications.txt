List of modifications for Yamaha FJ1100

1. FJ1100 front fork upgrade
http://www.fjowners.com/index.php?topic=1208.0;wap2


Get: FJ1200 Forks, from 89 and newer.

2. Callipers
Yamaha R1 or R6 up to 2003 mono-block callipers. They are a direct bolt-on to the '89-up FJ1200 fork legs, in either blue-pot, gold-pot, or silver-pot style. Some R-6, FZ-6, FZ-1, FJR1300 front callipers are the same.

3. FZR1000 front rim
* FZR1000 87 or 88 front rim
Will also need - 298mm '89 and newer FJ1200 break rotors
Either buy new OEM Yamaha pads for the R-1, or get some EBC FA252HH front pads (HH rated break pads).
Use the FJ wheel spacers and speedo drive.
Make sure you have the tab-washer that actually turns the speedo drive. 
Use the wheel bearings that came with the wheel, or buy new FJ  bearings.

* FZR1000 1989 and newer rim
With drilling
You can use 1989-up FZR1000 wheel, but you will need to drill the fork legs for the 17mm axle, and use the speedo-drive from the FZR1000. You would also need to source an FZR1000 axle and spacers. 

Without drilling:
Use 6203 LHA Ball Bearing.  Size 15x40x12
- non-ABS 15mm inner spacer. Spacer from my ABS model is too short.
- non-ABS collar spacer (between fork and wheel bearing) because ABS one is to short again.
- FJ1200 15mm axle and speedo driver.

4. Rear rim
* GSXR 750 90-95 or GSXR 1100 90-98 year rim
http://www.fj1200.info/Rims.htm
You need spacers, sprocket, rear disc and brake calliper and 2 big 20mm. flats, that fit to each side of the axel, between the spacers and the swing arm and a longer rear brake hose.

1) You will need everything what comes with the wheel - spacers, calliper hanger, calliper and brake line would help too.
2) You will also need 2x 4mm spacers with a 17mm diameter hole for on each side of the existing GSXR spacers.
3) You will need to get a tab welded to the underside of the swing arm (or another appropriate mounting point depending on the length of the torque arm)to connect the GSXR brake torque arm too.
4) You will also probably need to get an aftermarket rear sprocket for the GSXR wheel, as I think the smallest standard one is 43 tooth.

Other rear mods:
YZF600 rear
1988 FZR 1000

5. Master cylinder:
Fit a FZR 600, 1000 or FJR 1300 Nissin (not Brembo) master cylinder (all of them are the same item)


6. Sprockets
Best sprocket combinations:
Suzuki 38 tooth rear sprocket
1. 18/38
2. 18/39
3. 110 links chain.


7. Miscellaneous upgrades
